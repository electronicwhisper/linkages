Render fixed/unfixed points and lines appropriately
Make a point merge function





Make constraintSolver use arrays as well (to do vector math)
Make lines point to distance/slope constraints (as opposed to the other way around)




Make equal length
Make parallel
Make horizontal/vertical





Fix line distance
Make equal line length

Fix line slope
  make horizontal
  make vertical
Make parallel lines
Make perpendicular lines

Fix point location
Fix points on top of each other

Constrain point on line
  intersection (point on 2 lines)



Uniqueness
  Line on its two points
  Line's distance constraint
  Line's slope constraint
