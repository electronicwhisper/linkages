fix slope algorithms

make pointEqual constraint
make line tool






remove
  line if the two end points are the same
  point on line constraint if point is an endpoint of the line









Render fixed/unfixed points and lines appropriately
Make a point merge function












Make equal length
Make parallel
Make horizontal/vertical





Fix line distance
Make equal line length

Fix line slope
  make horizontal
  make vertical
Make parallel lines
Make perpendicular lines

Fix point location
Fix points on top of each other

Constrain point on line
  intersection (point on 2 lines)



Uniqueness
  Line on its two points
  Line's distance constraint
  Line's slope constraint
